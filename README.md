# Plotting time-integrated neutrino spectra from primordial black holes

## Overview

To simulate the life of evaporating primordial black holes and numerically calculate energy spectra, the public code [BlackHawk v.2.1](https://blackhawk.hepforge.org/) is used.

This code can be used to explore the prospects of detecting neutrinos produced by the evaporation of primordial black holes, in ground-based experiments. It makes use of neutrino fluxes from Hawking radiation computed with the open source code BlackHawk.
