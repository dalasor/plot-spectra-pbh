# Plotting time-integrated neutrino spectra from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) with log-normal mass distribution

## Overview

To simulate the life of evaporating primordial black holes and numerically calculate energy spectra, the public code [BlackHawk v.2.1](https://blackhawk.hepforge.org/) is used.

This code can be used as a template to plot your own plots using **matplotlib**.
